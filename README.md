# SMS-Spam-Dataset

This ExAIS_SMS Spam dataset was a project conducted at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria with the aim of building an indigenous SMS Spam corpus with African-English context. The dataset was collected from the above stated community with the consent of each particpant for the purpose of contributing and developing SMS corpus to aid further detection of SMS spam. 

The SMS dataset collected from 20 users of different mobile devices within the University community from both students, faculty member and non-teaching staff within the age group of 20-50 years old. A total of 5,240 SMS messages which consist of 2,350 Spam messages and 2,890 Ham (non-spam) messages was collected. Aside from the textual content, their are also some metadata included in the data such as users’ contact list, time stamp, date, sender's details, and their corresponding SMS messages. 

What am we trying to achieve with this SMS? This repository contains the raw SMS data. However, we have tried to mask some vital informations within the SMS such as bank account, phone numbers with the SMS, with the aim of ensuring users private details safety.
